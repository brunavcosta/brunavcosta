## Hi there 👋

I'm Bruna — dev wanting to turn into a AI Engineer 🚀

After 3 years of building things with code without a rep, I made the jump into the world of Machine Learning to show the world what I am building. 
Now I’m crafting intelligent systems, fine-tuning models, and giving OCR superpowers with AI. 

🔍 My interests lie in:

- AI & Machine Learning

- Computer Vision & OCR

- Data Science & Automation

- Generative AI & Prompt Engineering
  

🛠️ I'm currently working on:

- Smart document processing with LLMs

- Building agent-based AI pipelines

- Improving model performance and deployment workflows

  
🔬 Tech I vibe with:
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, OpenCV, LangChain, Hugging Face, and all things LLM 💥

🤖 I believe in building things that work and learning to grow even more as a professional.
